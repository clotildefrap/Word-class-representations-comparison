# Word-class-representations-comparison
This repository contains the work done for a project aiming at extracting the embeddings of different categories of words, with the primary intent being the comparison of the representations of function VS content words, extracted from three different layers (2, 8, 24) in two twenty-four layer models (BERT and GPT2).
